Termpicker is a terminal-based application designed to help users select and manipulate colors efficiently. Its keybindings are meant to be intuitive to vim users as it behaves in a modal way:

Normal mode:

	- h,l: decrease/increase the current slider coarsely by 5%
	- H,L: decrease/increase the current slider finely by 1
	- j,k: select the slider below/above
	- <Tab>,<S-Tab>: move to the next/previous tab
	- f,b : copy the color as an ANSI foreground/background escape code
	- x,r,s,c: copy the color as a hex, rgb, hsl, or cmyk value
  - ?: expand/shrink the help menu
  - i,<cmd>: enter Insert mode
  - q,<C-c>: quit the application

Insert mode:

	Manually type a color. Pressing  will cancel/leave insert mode. Anything in
	the following formats will be used as a color input when pressing enter:

	- Hex:   #rrggbb
	- RGB:   rgb( r, g, b)
	- CMYK:  cmyk(c, m, y, k)
	- HSL:   hsl(h, s, l)
